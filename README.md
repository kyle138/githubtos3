A Lambda bot that responds to GitHub pushes and deploys to S3.  
Now supports deploying only an optional subdirectory of the repo.

## Credits:
  By no means did I come up with all of this by myself. I drew heavy inspiration (and code) from the links below::  

  [Dynamic GitHub Actions with AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/dynamic-github-actions-with-aws-lambda/)  

  [JavaScript GitHub API for Node.JS](http://mikedeboer.github.io/node-github/)  

  [S3 Static Website Hosting](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/swh/website-hosting-intro.html)  
  
  The changes in V3.0.x which moved the trigger for this function from GitHub's SNS service to an API Gateway webhook drew heavy inspiration from the [Github Webhook Listener](https://serverless.com/examples/aws-node-github-webhook-listener/)

# githubtos3
A Lambda bot that responds to GitHub pushes and deploys to S3.
v3.1.0

## Configuration:
  **DEPRECATED**   Sorry, need to update documentation for V3.0.0 and up.
  Please see the full How-To hosted in S3 using this Lambda bot [here](http://githubtos3.kylemunz.com/).

## Credits:
  The changes in V3.0.x which moved the trigger for this function from GitHub's
  SNS service to an API Gateway webhook drew heavy inspiration from the
  [Github Webhook Listener](https://serverless.com/examples/aws-node-github-webhook-listener/)
